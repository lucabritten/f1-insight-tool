        <h1>Welcome to F1 Insight Tool</h1>
        <p>
            F1 Insight Tool is a lightweight data exploration application that provides structured insights into Formula 1 drivers 
            and seasons. Built with a Java Spring Boot backend and a simple web-based frontend, the tool retrieves and presents driver 
            statistics based on user input such as name and season year. It demonstrates a clean REST architecture, separation of 
            concerns, and modern web communication between frontend and backend. The project focuses on clarity, maintainability, 
            and practical application of dependency injection and API-driven design principles.
